# Multi-Stage-Cancer-Classification
Identification of different Cancer diseases is to determine first the type of scan
(breast or brain in our case) and then determining whether the scan is normal or
has a tumor and the type of tumor if exists, Disease detection is done with
different deep learning tasks such as classification, object detection, Image
segmentation, etc. In this project we will focus on applying Image classification
and segmentation.

## Project Objectives:
1- Apply different Image preprocessing techniques
2- Apply Image Classification to classify each image whether it is a brain scan or a Breast scan and then determining if the image scan is normal or if it has an infection (Tumor)
3- Apply Image segmentation to determine exactly the infected area location.

## Dataset:
The dataset can be found [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VRG99lvzfhdC-YA5dfdj_a9IyMCl5WHH/view]

## Project Deliverables:
1. Apply different Image Preprocessing and Enhancement techniques on the
dataset.
2. Apply Image classification to classify the given scan to “Breast” or “Brain” (1st
stage classification)
3. After determining the type of scan from the previous step then we determine
whether the scan is normal or has infection (2
nd stage classification)
3. Apply Image segmentation in order to identify the pixels of infected area
4- Determining also the width and height of tumor in the scan if exists
